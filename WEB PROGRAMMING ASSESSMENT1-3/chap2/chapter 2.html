        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>In 2045, Earth's population centers have deteriorated into slums, leading many to escape to the virtual reality world of OASIS, created by James Halliday. Anorak's Quest within OASIS promises ownership to whoever finds the Easter egg hidden behind three keys. Wade Watts, known as Parzival in OASIS, teams up with friends to solve the quest. They become known as the "High Five" after completing the first quest. IOI, a powerful corporation, seeks control of OASIS and attempts to recruit Wade, but he refuses. IOI attacks Wade's home, resulting in casualties. Wade discovers clues about Halliday's past and progresses through the quests. Ultimately, Wade outsmarts IOI, gains control of OASIS, and forms a partnership with his friends. They decide to limit OASIS access to encourage real-world engagement. Wade and his friend Samantha develop a romantic relationship and plan to live together.</p>

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>Wade Watts/Parzival - The novel’s protagonist who goes on a quest to find an Easter egg in the OASIS. Wade Watts is a high school student who lives in a trailer park in Oklahoma City. After growing up poor and spending most of his life in the OASIS, Wade leverages his knowledge and intellect in the hunt. Wade is a shy yet determined underdog who struggles against the corruption of the IOI. Throughout the novel, he matures and proves he is worthy of the prize.</p>
        <p>James Halliday/Anorak -The creator of the OASIS. James Halliday grew up in the 1970s and 1980s, when life was still comfortable for most people in America regardless of income. Halliday had an unhappy childhood and was obsessed with 1980s pop culture. He created the OASIS with Ogden Morrow. Halliday died a recluse and created the Easter egg hunt as a way to alleviate feelings of regret.</p>
        <p>Samantha Cook/Art3mis - One of the most famous gunters in the OASIS. Art3mis has a blog about Halliday that Wade follows and becomes obsessed with. Art3mis is very private and, like Wade, is a loner. She is very knowledgeable about Halliday and 1980s pop culture.</p>
        <p>Ogden Morrow - The co-founder of the OASIS. Ogden Morrow is charismatic and happy, the opposite of Halliday. He worried about the OASIS going down a dark path and started Halcydonia Interactive to make educational video games instead. Even after a falling-out with Halliday, he still has loyalty to him and agrees to ensure the competition’s integrity. </p>
        <p>Aech - Wade’s best friend and another famous gunter. Aech is rich from success in video game competitions. Aech is generous, supportive, and careful to never make Wade feel bad about being poor. It is revealed that Aech is actually a young Black woman close to Wade’s age named Helen Harris.</p>
